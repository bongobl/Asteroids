This remake of the Atari Asteroids game was written in Java with the LibGDX API

# how to compile
LibGDX projects use gradle to build their games. To import, create a new gradle project and import the EclipseDemo folder. Make sure all jars in the libs folder (for both core and desktop) are part of the build path. Run the desktop launcher enjoy!

# how to run
Make sure you have the JRE 1.8 or higher and download the Asteroids.jar file.
